== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. Will this plugin work on my WordPress.COM website? =
A. Sorry, this plugin is available for use only on self-hosted (WordPress.ORG) websites.

= Q. Can I use this plugin on my language? =
A. Yes. This plugin is ready for translation and has already been translated into several languages. But If your language is not available then you can make one. The POT file is included and placed in the "`languages`" folder. Just send the PO file to me at the arthurgareginyan@gmail.com and I will include this translation within the next plugin update. Many of plugin users would be delighted if you share your translation with the community. Thanks for your contribution!

= Q. How does it work? =
A. Simply go to the plugin settings page, place your CSS code in the field, switch the toggle to the "ON" position and click the "Save changes" button. Enjoy the result of applying your CSS code. It's that simple!
You can find the plugin settings page at "`WP Admin Panel`" -> "`Appearance`" -> "`Custom Styles`".

= Q. How much of CSS code (characters) I can enter in the text field? =
A. I don't limit the number of characters.

= Q. Does this plugin requires any modification of the theme? =
A. Absolutely not. This plugin is configurable entirely from the plugin settings page that you can find in the Admin Panel of your WordPress website.

= Q. Does this require any knowledge of HTML or CSS? =
A. This plugin can be configured with no knowledge of HTML or CSS, using an easy-to-use plugin settings page. But you need to know the HTML or CSS in order to add/remove/modify the HTML or CSS code by using this plugin.

= Q. It's not working. What could be wrong? =
A. As with every plugin, it's possible that things don't work. The most common reason for this is a web browser's cache. Every web browser stores a cache of the websites you visit (pages, images, and etc.) to reduce bandwidth usage and server load. This is called the browser's cache.​ Clearing your browser's cache may solve the problem.

It's impossible to tell what could be wrong exactly, but if you post a support request in the plugin's support forum on WordPress.org, I'd be happy to give it a look and try to help out. Please include as much information as possible, including a link to your website where the problem can be seen.

= Q. The last WordPress update is preventing me from editing my website that is using this plugin. Why is this? =
A. This plugin can not cause such problem. More likely, the problem are related to the settings of the website. It could just be a cache, so please try to clear your website's cache (may be you using a caching plugin, or some web service such as the CloudFlare) and then the cache of your web browser. Also please try to re-login to the website, this too can help.

= Q. Where to report bug if found? =
A. Please visit the [Dedicated Plugin Page on GitHub](https://github.com/ArthurGareginyan/my-custom-styles) and report.

= Q. Where to share any ideas or suggestions to make the plugin better? =
A. Any suggestions are very welcome! Please send me an email to [arthurgareginyan@gmail.com](mailto:arthurgareginyan@gmail.com). Thank you!

= Q. I love this plugin! Can I help somehow? =
A. Yes, any financial contributions are welcome! Just visit [my website](https://www.arthurgareginyan.com/donate.html), click on the donate button, and thank you!
